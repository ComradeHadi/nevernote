Welcome to NeverNote 0.86

This is an incomplete clone of Evernote designed to run on Linux.  It is written in Java so it will also run on other platforms as well but the primary focus has been to try and get a usable environment for Linux.  While this is designed to work with Evernote, it is in no way connected with or supported by Evernote.  Any problems you encounter will not be corrected by them and, since this is GPL software, you are using this software at your own risk.  See release.txt for details of what works and what doesn't work.

Before trying to run this, please be sure you have Java 1.6 and QT Jambi 4.5 installed.  Java will probably be installed via a package manager and you'll probably need to download QT Jambi from    http://qt.nokia.com/downloads.  The only thing you need to do with Jambi is to have the files untarred to a directory.  People have used this with both 64 & 32 bit versions of Linux as well as OpenJDK & Sun's Java and (so far) have not encountered any problems with these different environments.


--- To Install ---                         
1.) Edit nevernote.sh (for Linux) or nevernote.bat (for Windows) in this directory.  At the top of the file there will be 4 variables.
2.) Edit the NEVERNOTE variable to point to the full path of where you installed NeverNote.
3.) Edit the JAMBI_LOCATION variable to point to the full path of where QT Jambi was installed.
4.) Edit the JABBI_VERSION variable to indicate the proper QT Jambi version you have installed.  I've tested with 4.5 only.  I don't think older versions will work.
5.) Edit the JAMBI_PLATFORM variable to indicate the Linux/Windows platform you are running.       

There are additional options if you wish to run multiple copies under the same userid.  These settings are optional and, depending upon your needs, you probably don't need to touch them.  Please see either nevernote.sh or nevernote.bat for details.  

Some archive managers do not untar all subdirectories properly because some of the subdirectories are initially empty.  After untarring, you should see a lib, res, images, db, and logs directories directly under the nevernote directory.  Some of these will be empty until you begin running the program.

When running the program, please start it from within the directory you installed it from.  For example, if you have it installed in /home/randy/nevernote, please issue the ./nevernote.sh command from within the nevernote directory.  Don't do a /home/randy/nevernote/nevernote.sh from another directory.  I'll eventually remove this restriction when I get the time.

If you've read this far and have done everything described above then you're done.  You should be able to run the nevernote.sh script and start things up.  The initial synchronize will take a while depending upon the amount of data. 

This prgram has the ability to synchronize against production servers as well as sandbox servers or to use multiple accounts under the same Linux/Windows ID.  Please see the startup script for details if you wish to run multiple copies under the same Linux or Windows userid.     DO NOT MIX PRODUCTION & SANDBOX DATA IN THE SAME DATABASE OR HAVE MULTIPLE USER ACCOUNTS IN THE SAME DATABASE!        Using the same database to store both production & sandbox data or multiple Evernote accounts will cause problems.   If you wish to run multiple copies of NeverNote you must have separate installation directories for each and you MUST edit the startup scripts and give any one after the first a separate name.  

Please remember this is beta software.  As such, you can expect to encounter problems.  Also please note that until I get to version 1.0 I do not guarantee clean upgrades.  This means I may ask you to delete everything & start over when upgrading.  This can cause you to lose any unsynchronized data.  I really hope to not need to do this and will try to provide upgrades if possible, but it is a matter of time versus effort.  Since only a few people are using it I don't want to put in an enormous amount of time to do clean upgrades.  If this causes a lot of heartache please let me know and I'll try to provide something better.
       


Changes from 0.86                   
- Some backend tuning has been done to make it more responsive when switching notebooks or tags.
- Some backend logic has been change to hopefully make it less prone to lockups.
- Added PDF navigation arrows.  If you have PDF preview enabled then you should see left & right arrows above the PDF to allow basic scrolling.
- Added basic GPS information support for notes.
- Fixed some unicode display problems in various places. 
- Altered startup logic to check if directories are missing.
- Altered startup logic to not delete directory contents if another copy of NeverNote is running.
- Fixed a problem where synchronized notebooks were not being properly recognized and could result in duplicate notebook names.
- Fixed a problem where a new tag wouldn't be added to the tag tree on the left if a new tag was created by typing its name in the note tag text field. 
 


---- Known Problems ----
- Very complex documents can cause the program to crash because it can't clean up the documents well enough to pass Evernote's markup requirements.
- When doing a drag & drop from the desktop onto an note to create an attachment, NeverNote must be the window that has focus prior to beginning the drag.  If it did not have focus immediately prior to beginning the drag you will not see any attachment created.  If anyone has any idea how to force Webkit JavaScript to grab focus I'd be glad to hear it.  It seems to ignore pasting otherwise.
- It won't highlight words on a search completion if they are broken up by a format change.  For example, if you search for Mississippi, words like   Mississippi  and Missippi will be highlighted, but Mississippi won't be because the bold breaks up the word.  This doesn't impact search results, just highlighting them.
- There is a focus problem on some dialog boxes where control is not returned to the editor after closing a dialog using either the escape or return keys.  To get around this, just press Alt-Tab to switch windows and then switch back to regain focus.



---- Known Limitation ----           
- Only a subset of the search syntax is supported.
- There is no spell checking.
- Only the first page of a PDF can be viewed inline.
- There is no screen clipper.
- Emailing only sends the plain text of a note.
- Ink notes are not supported.


--- Note 6/19/2010 on coloring the background of a note ---
First, this idea is shamelessly stolen from the user forums.  Thanks for the suggestion!  Evernote provides the ability to change the background color of a note, but not all the clients support this.  That means you can change the background in NeverNote and it may (or may not) display properly in another client.  However, if you edit a note in another client (or on the web) it may change the background color back to white.  It depends upon the client's ability to preserve that attribute.  This is not the same as changing the note list color (see the next note).

Note on changing the background of a note in the list
First, this idea is shamelessly stolen from the user forums.  Thanks for the suggestion!  This feature can be found by right clicking on the window that contains the notes list.  This is not supported by Evernote.  It will also not be included when the data is synchronized since I can't find a good way to pass the data through Evernote's servers without causing an error.  This data is preserved, however, when backing up & restoring the database.

What does this mean?  It means that if you run NeverNote on two computers, changing the background color in the note list will not change the display on the other computer.  This is not the same as changing the background color of a note (see the previous note).


--- Note 4/6/2010 on Deleting Notes ---
The Evernote API allows you to delete notes permanently by using their API.  I was using this function to delete notes when a user emptied the trash.  Apparently some other developers ilked it so much they began deleting stuff that the users wanted to keep.  When this happened, Evernote gets blamed first and they need to spend time fixing the problem.  To prevent them from having this problem in the future they have restricted the ability to permanently delete notes, but provided a way to easily move them to the trash can and they'll then allow you to empty the trash can via the Web interface or one of their clients.

What does this mean?

NeverNote has a trash can, but if I followed their suggestions it would mean that you could never empty the trash without first logging onto their web interface, emptying the trash, and then synchronizing again.  Kind of a bummer.  If I just emptied the trash on my end and not on Evernote's end the notes can magically reappear.  To get around the problem, I modified some of the logic.  When you delete a note, it is moved to the trash (the same as before).  If you synchronize then the note is moved to the trash on Evernote's servers.  If you empty the trash the note will disappear from the trash can, but if you do a sync the note is NOT removed from their trash.  Basically, I'm just hiding the note and placing it in a "virtual" trash can that you can't see, but NeverNote still uses to keep track of the note itself.  If you empty the trash on the Web and do a sync the data is then permanently deleted from NeverNote.  

I understand Evernote's push for this and, if you don't mind an eternal trashcan on the web interface, it is a nice security feature in case you accidentally delete something.  The only bad thing is that if you look at the notes in the trash on the web client they may not match the count on your local server.


--- Note 4/2/2010 on Saved Userid & Password ---
A few people have asked, so I want to explain how NeverNote saves your userid & password for Evernote.  

First, it does not save them by default.  You must set this up in the Edit/Preferences dialog box.  If you choose to save your userid & password it will store them in an encrypted file called secure.txt.  The file is encrypted so the average user can't browse it, but it is not secure from anyone who is determined.  The reason for this is simple.  While the file itself is secure, NeverNote needs to be able to read the file so the program itself has the key.  Since it is open source, anyone with a little ambition can get the key by reading the source and decrypt the file.  If you need true security, I recommend installing NeverNote in an encrypted directory (Linux has really nice in-system encryption) or using something like TrueCrypt.


--- Note 3/71/2010 on Customizing Shortcuts ---
As of the 0.71 release you have the ability to customize the shortcuts for menu items within NeverNote.  I haven't built a graphical setup for this, but the shortcuts_howoto.txt file in the install directory contains information on how to customize shortcuts.  If you do not customize the shortcuts you will continue to use the defaults.


--- Note 2/10/2010 on Closing & Opening Notebooks ---
I have added a feature to NeverNote that does not exist in the Evernote client.  This feature is available under the "File/Notebook" menu and it provides the ability to close or open a notebook.  All this really does is to exclude the closed notebooks from being visible on the notebook panel and any search results will not include notes from those notebooks.  It does not impact the ability to synchronize those notebooks or any notes within them.  All notes are also indexed the same as any normal note. 

Why?

There are two main benefits to using this feature.  The first is performance.  By closing a notebook the program automatically filters them, so there is less overhead to managing them.  This is really noticeable if you have a notebook with a large number of notes.  The second benefit is that you don't need to look at them.  If you are like me and have a notebook for things that are seldom used you can reduce the clutter of looking through those notes until you are sure you need them.  Closing & opening a notebook takes a few seconds (depending upon your database size) but it can be done at any time.  Any searches that are performed will not include notes in these notebooks.  Please let me know if you find this feature useful.
