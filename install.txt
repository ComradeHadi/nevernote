Welcome to NeverNote.     

This is a very basic clone of Evernote designed to run on Linux.
It is written in Java so it will also run on other platforms as well but the primary focus has been to try 
and get a usable environment for Linux.

See release.txt for details of what works and what doesn't work.

--- Requirement ---

Before trying, please be sure you have Java 1.6 and QT Jambi 4.5 and later versions installed.

 - Java
   Java will probably be installed via a package manager. This product is tested on Oracle/Sun Java
   1.6 and OpenJDK 6.
 
 - QtJambi
   Jambi is a implementation of Qt GUI library on Java environment.
   You'll probably need to download QT Jambi from  http://qtjambi.sourceforge.net/
   or http://qt.qualtech.com/download
   This product is tested agains qtjambi 4.5.2_01 now.

The only thing you need to do with Jambi is to have the files untarred to a directory. 
You'll need to edit the install scripts to point to this directory (the instructions are below).  
People have used this with both 64 & 32 bit versions of Linux as well as OpenJDK & Sun's Java 
and (so far) have not encountered any problems with these different environments.


--- To Install --- 

1.) Extract binary distribution package on a directory.
     If you use Linux/Unix OS,  you may prefer to extract it in ~/NeverNote
     If you use MS-Windows, you may extract it in D:/NeverNote

    Some archive managers do not untar all subdirectories properly because some of the subdirectories
    are initially empty.  After untarring, you should see a lib, res, images, db, qss, and logs directories 
    directly under the nevernote directory.
    Some of these will be empty until you begin running the program.

2.) Edit nevernote.sh (for Linux) or nevernote.bat (for Windows) in this directory. 
     At the top of the file there will be 4 variables.
2-1.) Edit the NEVERNOTE variable to point to the full path of where you installed NeverNote.
2-2.) Edit the JAMBI_LOCATION variable to point to the full path of where QT Jambi was installed.
2-3) Edit the JABBI_VERSION variable to indicate the proper QT Jambi version you have installed.
     I've tested with 4.5 only.  I don't think older versions will work.
2-4.) Edit the JAMBI_PLATFORM variable to indicate the Linux/Windows platform you are running.  

3.)  Launch nevernote.sh (for Linux) or nevernote.bat (for Windows) to start

4.)  Enjoy!



--- Configuration ---

There are additional options if you wish to run multiple copies under the same userid. 
These settings are optional and, depending upon your needs, you probably don't need to touch them. 

Thera are also additional options to tune a performance of Java Virtual Machine. If you do not aware,
don't touch it. If you use recent multi-core and high performance CPU, its change may improve 
a performance.

Please see either nevernote.sh or nevernote.bat for details.  


--- Run ---

If you've read this far and have done everything described above then you're done.  You should be
able to run the nevernote.sh (or nevernote.bat for Windows) script and start things up.
The initial synchronize will take a while depending upon the amount of data.  

This prgram has the ability to synchronize against production servers as well as sandbox servers 
or to use multiple accounts under the same Linux/Windows ID.  
Please see the startup script for details if you wish to run multiple copies under the same Linux or 
Windows userid.   

DO NOT MIX PRODUCTION & SANDBOX DATA IN THE SAME DATABASE OR HAVE
MULTIPLE USER ACCOUNTS IN THE SAME DATABASE!

Using the same database to store both production & sandbox data or multiple Evernote accounts 
will cause problems.      If you wish to run multiple copies of NeverNote you must have separate 
installation directories for each and you MUST edit the startup scripts and give any one 
after the first a separate name.  By default, it will try to use the sandbox servers.
If you wish to use production data you can change this under the Edit/Preferences directory option.  

You must change this BEFORE your first synchronization with Evernote. 

--- Build from source ---

1. Directories and pre-requisite

Source package contains several directories.

 src/    java soruce files
 lib/    dependent Java libraries 
 qss/    GUI design definitions
 images/ icons and logos
 xml/    a protocol definition in XML
 translations/   localized message catalogs

To build from source package, you need several additional  utilities and developers kit.

  JDK:
       Java standard developers distribution.  you can download it from http://www.java.com/
       or as Linux  package

  lupdate, lrelease: 
       translation helper  ulitilites
       These tools is bundled with qtjambi distribution where bin/ directory of qtjambi 

2. Build on Eclipse Integrated Development Environment

<TBD>

There are sample project files and classpath definitions
in the source tree.


3. Build by command line 

To build without Eclipse IDE, you need to prepare 'ant' utility.
 
 - Compile and build  jar file

   $ ant jar

 - Update translation files

   $  ant update-tr

 - Clean binaries and temporary files

   $ ant clean
       or
   $ ant all-clean
 
 - edit translations
  
    please see translations/README


--- Caution!!! ----

Please remember this is beta software.  As such, you can expect to encounter problems. 
Also please note that until I get to version 1.0 I do not guarantee clean upgrades.  
This means I may ask you to delete everything & start over when upgrading.  This can cause you 
to lose any unsynchronized data.  I really hope to not need to do this and will try to provide upgrades 
if possible, but it is a matter of time versus effort.  Since only a few people are using it I don't want to
put in an enormous amount of time to do clean upgrades.  If this causes a lot of heartache 
please let me know and I'll try to provide something better.
